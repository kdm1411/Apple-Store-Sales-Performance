### Recomendations.

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:

- Given that Montana state has the highest order acrcoss the country, the marketing team should focus more campaigns in the state and other states as well.
- Olive color was the customers best choices of color, they should feature products available in this color.
- About 1,000 produts was ordered during the spring season which makes the season most highest in terms orders, campaingns should be launch at the season to drive more revenue.
- Pants, Blouse and jewelry are the most ordered products, they should be prioritize in the marketing campaings.

### Limitations.

I had to filter out the NA values from the Color column because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclutions from the analysis. The age column has to be categorize into ranges like teenage, adult & Old age for better analysis and visualisation.
